## üõ†Ô∏è Script Functionality
The script will:
-   Offer to install or update Cursor.
-   **During Installation:**
    -   Check for and install `curl` if missing.
    -   Check for and install `libfuse2` if missing (important for running AppImages).
    -   Move the specified Cursor AppImage to `/opt/Cursor/cursor.AppImage`.
    -   Make the AppImage executable.
    -   Download a chosen icon to `/opt/Cursor/cursor-icon.png`.
    -   Create a desktop entry (`/usr/share/applications/cursor.desktop`) for easy access.
-   **During Update:**
    -   Download the new Cursor AppImage, replacing the old one in `/opt/Cursor/`.
    -   Ensure the new AppImage is executable.

## üß© Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1.  Ensure you have `sudo` privileges and an active internet connection.
2.  Verify that the AppImage download path you provided is correct and accessible.
3.  Confirm the icon filename exists in the `images` directory of the `hieutt192/Cursor-ubuntu` GitHub repository.
4.  If Cursor fails to start after installation, ensure `libfuse2` was installed correctly. The script attempts this, but you can manually check/install with `sudo apt update && sudo apt install libfuse2`.
5.  Check script permissions (`chmod +x your_script_name.sh`).
